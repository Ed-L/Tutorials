## Welcome

Welcome to Hinsa Lab's tutorial site. This site was created by Ed Lopatto to document bioinformatic skills he preformed during a MAP in the Summer of 2018. 

This site is a work in progress as Ed slowly crawls on his way to learning github and rmarkdown.
Any questions can be directed to lopattoe@grinnell.edu
